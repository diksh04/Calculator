A calculator app made using React.js is a web application that simulates the functionality of a basic calculator. React.js, being a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is well-suited for creating interactive and dynamic applications like a calculator.

Key Features:

1. User Interface: The app provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface resembling a traditional calculator. It typically includes buttons for numbers, arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), decimal point, equal sign, and additional functionality like clear (AC), backspace (DEL), etc.
2. Display Panel: A display panel shows the numbers and operators entered by the user and the result of the calculations. React.js allows for easy updating of the display as the user interacts with the calculator.
3. Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator app should support basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers and perform calculations by clicking on the appropriate buttons.
4. Order of Operations: The calculator should follow the standard order of operations (BODMAS) when evaluating complex expressions, ensuring accurate results.
5. Decimal Precision: The app should handle decimal numbers accurately and display results with the appropriate precision.
6. Clear and Backspace Functionality: Users should be able to clear the entire calculation or remove the last input using clear (AC) and backspace (DEL) buttons, respectively.
7. Responsive Design: React.js makes it easy to create a responsive design that works well on various devices, ensuring the calculator app is accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Overall, a calculator app built using React.js provides an interactive and efficient way for users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. The app's responsiveness, dynamic user interface, and smooth functionality make it a practical tool for users across different platforms. More advanced features can be added to cater to users who require scientific or specialized calculations.
